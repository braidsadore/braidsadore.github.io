Midback: Midback hair refers to hair that reaches down to approximately the middle of the back. This length can vary slightly depending on individual height and proportions, but generally, it falls around the area where the lower ribs end.

Waist length: Waist-length hair is hair that extends all the way down to the natural waistline of the body. This length typically falls somewhere between the lower back and the upper hips.

Midbut: Midbut hair is a playful term combining "mid" and "butt," indicating hair that falls to about the midpoint of the buttocks. It's a longer length than midback and is characterized by its ability to reach or nearly reach the bottom of the buttocks.

Topbut: Topbut hair is hair that falls just at the top of the buttocks. It's a bit shorter than midbut length, reaching the upper portion of the buttocks without extending fully to the midsection.

Underbut: Underbut hair is a term referring to hair that extends beneath the buttocks, reaching the area below them. This length usually falls several inches below the buttock crease.

Handbraid: Handbraids are braids created by weaving sections of hair together using only the hands, without the assistance of any tools or accessories. They can vary in thickness and style, ranging from simple three-strand braids to more intricate designs like fishtail braids or Dutch braids.

Jumbo braids: Jumbo braids are large, chunky braids created using thick sections of hair. These braids are typically larger in size compared to regular braids, giving them a bold and distinctive appearance. They can be styled in various ways, such as individual jumbo braids, jumbo braided ponytails, or jumbo braided buns.
